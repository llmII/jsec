* Welcome

Thank you for considering contributing to jsec! This document explains our standards and processes.

* Code Standards

** Janet Code Style

- Use ~let~ and ~with~ macros instead of ~def~, ~defer~, ~var~ where sensible
- Prefer keyword symbols over strings (e.g., ~:TLS1_3~ instead of ~"TLS1.3"~)
- Follow conventions in [[file:STYLE.org][STYLE.org]]
- Format code with ~jfmt~: =jpm run format-janet=
- Soft limit: 78 columns, hard limit: 80 columns (janet-format won't help with
  this so it's okay sometimes for lines to be longer until a tool exists to
  aid in this)

** C Code Style

- K&R style (see [[file:.astylerc][.astylerc]])
- 4-space indentation
- Pointer alignment: ~int *ptr~
- Format code with ~astyle~: =jpm run format-c=
- Soft limit: 78 columns, hard limit: 80 columns
- Comment complex logic, not obvious operations
- Use Janet OS macros for platform guards
- No compiler warnings allowed

** Comments

- Comment what code does, not implementation history
- Clarify non-obvious logic
- Do not comment trivial operations (~2+2=4~)
- No "we used to do X, now we do Y" comments
- Focus on "why" rather than "what" for complex sections

* Testing Requirements

** All Contributions Must Include Tests

New functionality or extended functionality *must* be appropriately tested for a contribution to be accepted.

** Running Tests

jsec uses the [[https://github.com/llmII/janet-assay][assay]] testing framework.

#+begin_src sh
# Run unit, regression, and coverage tests (recommended for development)
janet test/runner.janet -f '{unit,regression,coverage}'

# Run all tests (includes performance - takes hours)
janet test/runner.janet

# Dry run to see what would execute
janet test/runner.janet -f '{unit,regression,coverage}' --dry-run

# Run specific suite
janet test/runner.janet -f 'unit/tls-stream'

# Run specific test within a suite
janet test/runner.janet -f 'unit/tls-stream/handshake'

# Verbose output
janet test/runner.janet -f '{unit,regression,coverage}' --verbosity 2

# List all available tests
janet test/runner.janet --list all
#+end_src

See [[file:docs/TESTING.org][docs/TESTING.org]] for comprehensive testing documentation.

** Test Requirements

- All existing tests must pass
- New features require corresponding test cases
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Tests should work on Unix sockets as well as TCP (for TLS, for UDP we'll update when DTLS is good)
- External connections only to example.com (tests should gracefully handle failures)
- Tests must be concise for valgrind performance (though this obviously won't fix valgrind being too slow presently)
- No stubbed or incomplete tests accepted

** Test Style

- Tests are organized into suites in ~suites/~ directory by category
- Use assay's ~def-test~ macro for defining tests
- Use ~(test-setup)~ and ~(test-teardown)~ for fixture management
- Clean up resources properly
- Test both function calls and method calls (~(:read stream)~ and ~(tls/read stream)~)
- Test error conditions, not just happy paths
- Use matrix tests for testing across configurations (TLS versions, protocols, etc.)

** C Projects: Memory Testing

For projects with C code, memory checking is mandatory (once developer tooling works appropriately):

#+begin_src sh
# Check for memory leaks with valgrind
jpm run leak-check # valgrind is slow, elide this or help fix things to be speedy enough

# Run tests with AddressSanitizer/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer
jpm run test-sanitized # Address sanitizer is slow, UBSan is fine though

# Run clang-tidy static analysis
jpm run tidy
#+end_src

* Pull Request Process

** Repository Information

- *Primary repository*: ~code.amlegion.org/jsec~ (Fossil)
- *Mirror*: ~https://github.com/llmII/jsec~ (Git)
- Contributions accepted via Git or Fossil
- Git contributions will be converted to patches and applied with Fossil
- We attempt to credit contributor's GitHub/Git name appropriately

** Submission Process

1. Fork the repository (Git) or request commit access (Fossil)
2. Create a feature branch: ~git checkout -b feature/my-feature~
3. Make your changes following code standards
4. Add tests for your changes in appropriate suite under ~suites/~
5. Run test suite: ~janet test/runner.janet -f '{unit,regression,coverage}'~
6. Format your code: ~jpm run format~
7. *If C code*: Run memory checks: ~jpm run leak-check~ and ~jpm run test-sanitized~ (once tooling for such stabilizes)
8. Update documentation in ~docs/~ if needed
9. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
10. Push to your fork and submit a pull request (Git) or commit (Fossil)

** PR Checklist

- [ ] Code follows style guidelines
- [ ] All tests pass (~janet test/runner.janet -f '{unit,regression,coverage}'~)
- [ ] New tests added for new functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Code formatted with ~jpm run format~
- [ ] *If C code*: Memory checks pass (~jpm run leak-check~, ~jpm run test-sanitized~) (once tooling for such stabilizes)
- [ ] *If C code*: No compiler warnings
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and descriptive

* Documentation

- Use org-mode files (~.org~), not Markdown
- API documentation goes in ~docs/API.org~
- Guides go in ~docs/GUIDE.org~
- Reference examples in ~examples/~ directory
- Generate Markdown with ~jpm run release~

* Getting Help

- Check existing tests for patterns
- Read [[file:docs/API.org][API documentation]]
- Look at [[file:examples/][examples]] directory
- Review [[file:STYLE.org][style guide]]
