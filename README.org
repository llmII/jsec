#+TITLE: JSEC - TLS/SSL Library for Janet
#+AUTHOR: llmII <dev@amlegion.org>
#+DATE: 2025-11-29

* Overview

*jsec* (JSEC) is a TLS/SSL library for Janet that aims to be production-quality, built on OpenSSL. It features proper async integration with Janet's event loop (`ev/`), a security-first design, and comprehensive support for both client and server modes.

** API Compatibility Guarantee

The primary design goal of `jsec` is strict compatibility with Janet's standard Stream API.

- **Initialization:** The only intended difference is in connection initialization (e.g., `tls/connect` vs `net/connect`).
- **Behavior:** Once established, a TLS stream should behave *identically* to a standard TCP stream for all methods (`:read`, `:write`, `:close`, `:chunk`, etc.).
- **Extensions:** Where the standard API uses optional arguments (`&opt`), `jsec` may offer extensions. These arguments function as an "either/or" mechanism: they strictly support the standard Janet Stream API conventions but may *also* accept library-specific values (e.g., TLS-specific configuration tables) where appropriate.

**Any deviation in behavior from the standard Janet Stream API (unexpected blocking, method signature mismatches, return value differences) when used in a standard context is considered a bug.** The author has validated this to the best of their ability, but if you encounter any such inconsistency, please report it immediately.

* ⚠️ Security and Auditing Disclaimer

This library implements critical cryptographic protocols. Users must understand the risks associated with this type of software:

- **NO formal security audit has been performed on this codebase.** While the library aims to follow strict engineering and testing standards, we recommend users perform their own risk assessment before deploying in high-value or sensitive production environments. Use at your own risk.
- **Cryptographic Primitives:** The security of the library relies heavily on the underlying C libraries (OpenSSL). While these libraries are industry standards, the binding layer and integration logic have not yet undergone external security review.
- **Vulnerability Reporting:** We highly encourage community review. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it immediately via a fossil ticket or GitHub issue as a public issue. We will address valid reports as promptly as possible. Once the library has been audited in the future this section will be updated with information on how to submit privately so that a fix can be made before the issue is made publicly known, but during this phase of development there is no reason such should not be public by default, and we will strive to keep things as public by default even in the future unless there is a true worry that disclosure might lead to abuse.

* ✅ Robust Testing & Stability Assurance

While a security audit is pending, the library maintains high standards for functional correctness and stability:

- **Comprehensive Test Suite:** The library currently passes over **2,000 automated functional tests** covering handshake procedures, certificate validation, data transfer, error handling, and various edge cases. The high test count is derived from a matrix of test configurations (TLS versions, cipher suites, underlying raw protocol, etc.) run against every functional test case.
- **Performance Benchmarking (Experimental):** A preliminary performance testing framework (perf9) exists for benchmarking throughput, latency, and scalability. *Note: Performance testing is unstable - output formats, metrics, and implementation details are subject to change. Both Janet and C-side optimizations are ongoing.*
  - Protocol comparison (TCP vs TLS vs Unix sockets)
  - TLS version performance comparison
  - Scaling tests across client counts
  - Concurrency mode testing (fibers, threads, subprocesses)
  - Handshake timing analysis
- **Continuous Integration:** Tests are run automatically on every commit via GitHub Actions across Linux environments to ensure ongoing stability. (planned)

** Example Performance Output
Note that perf can be somewhat skewed by testing framework intricacies but it
gives a bit of an idea.

** Testing Status & Maturity

Although the test count is high, effectively approaching fuzzing-level coverage, the library is still in active development. While the current test suite has successfully prevented known bugs, coverage is not yet exhaustive. Users should assume that testing requires further refinement, even though the current state is robust. The test infrastructure includes mechanisms to track expected failures and skips, ensuring that the matrix of scenarios is handled correctly.

  :days-valid 30
}))

(spit "cert.pem" (certs :cert))
(spit "key.pem" (certs :key))
#+END_SRC

** STARTTLS Upgrade

Upgrade an existing plaintext connection to TLS.

#+BEGIN_SRC janet
(import jsec/tls)

# 1. Connect in plaintext
(def stream (net/connect "smtp.example.com" "25"))

# ... perform plaintext handshake (EHLO, STARTTLS) ...
(:write stream "STARTTLS\r\n")
(:read stream 1024) # Consume server response

# 2. Upgrade to TLS
(print "Upgrading...")
(def tls-stream (tls/upgrade stream "smtp.example.com" {
  :verify true
}))

# 3. Continue securely
(:write tls-stream "AUTH PLAIN ...")
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC janet
(import jsec/dtls)

# Client
(def udp-socket (net/connect "127.0.0.1" "4433" :datagram))
(def dtls-client (dtls/client udp-socket {:verify true}))

(dtls/write dtls-client "Hello DTLS")
(print (dtls/read dtls-client 1024))
(dtls/close dtls-client)

# Server

* Contributing

We welcome contributions! JSEC is an ambitious project and there are many areas where community help would be valuable.

** Areas Seeking Help

*** Platform Support
- *Windows:* Testing, debugging, and CI improvements for Windows builds
- *Cross-platform testing:* Help test on additional BSD variants or Linux distributions

*** Testing & Quality
- *Test Suite Expansion:* Additional edge cases, protocol scenarios, error conditions
- *Sanitizer Integration:* Improving ASan/UBSan/LSan coverage and CI integration
- *Fuzzing:* Setting up continuous fuzzing infrastructure
- *Code Review:* Security-focused review of the C binding layer

**** Quick Wins for New Contributors
Looking for an easy way to get started? These focused improvements help build familiarity with the codebase:

- *Convert server/client tests to assay coordinated tests:* Many TLS/DTLS tests manually spawn server and client fibers with ~ev/sleep~ delays to coordinate timing. These patterns are ideal candidates for conversion to assay's ~coordinated~ test type, which provides built-in participant synchronization via barriers and channels. While ~coordinated~ was designed for performance testing, it works well for any multi-participant scenario requiring coordination. See ~suites/performance/~ for examples.
- *Expand matrix test coverage:* assay's ~matrix~ feature generates test combinations automatically. Originally designed for fuzz testing parameter spaces, matrices are useful anywhere you need to test across multiple configurations (TLS versions, cipher suites, buffer sizes, etc.). Look for tests with manual loops over configurations that could be converted to declarative matrices.

*** Performance
- *C-side Optimizations:* Buffer handling, memory allocation patterns
- *Janet-side Optimizations:* API layer efficiency improvements
- *Benchmarking:* Expanding the perf9 test matrix and analysis tools
- *Profiling:* Identifying bottlenecks under various workloads
